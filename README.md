# Candidate Management System

A full-stack application to manage job candidates for recruiters. This system allows users to add, view, update, and delete candidate information with a clean, responsive React front end and a robust backend API.

## Project Overview

This project is designed as part of a training program to demonstrate the following key skills:

- Building CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with RESTful APIs
- Handling relational data (candidates & jobs)
- Front-end development with React (component-based architecture)
- Backend API development using modern frameworks (Node.js with Express, Python or Java)
- Database design and management with SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or similar)
- Proper code organization, git version control, and documentation

---

## Features

- **Candidate Management**: Add new candidates with name, email, phone number, current status, and resume link
- **Candidate Listing**: View candidates in a paginated and sortable table
- **Update & Delete**: Edit candidate details or delete candidates from the system
- **Form Validation**: Front-end validation for proper input (email format, phone number length, etc.)
- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive interface built with React and Bootstrap
- **API Documentation**: Integrated Swagger UI for backend API endpoints (if available)
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented role-based permissions for secure access (if applicable)
